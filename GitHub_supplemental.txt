Supplementary Text 1:

The rotamer data generated in this work are freely available via GitHub.  To download the rotamer database, first install git, and then (in a terminal) run the command:

	git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/rlabduke/reference_data.git

This will download the Richardson Lab reference data repository into a new subdirectory called reference_data.  It contains the Top8000-generated rotamer data in reference_data/Top8000.  The database requires a few hundred megabytes of disk space at the time of publication.  

If you are experienced with SVN, you can instead use the command:
	svn export https://github.com/rlabduke/reference_data.git/trunk/ reference_data

You can also browse the data online at https://github.com/rlabduke/reference_data/tree/master/Top8000.  Most of the data files are too large to interact with in a browser.  GitHub has a “raw” option to view text files directly in your browser available from each individual file's page after navigating to it in your browser, or via URLs of the form https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlabduke/reference_data/master/Top8000/Top8000-SFbest_hom50_pdb_chain_list.csv, where the URL path after master/ is identical to the file path in the repository proper.

In the Top8000 database, you will find:

* Top8000_best_hom##_pdb_chain_list.csv, a list of high data quality PDB chains at varying homology levels
* Top8000_SFbest_hom##_pdb_chain_list.csv, a list of high data quality PDB chains at varying homology levels that also have structure factor data deposited
* Top8000_rotamer_pdb_chain_count.csv , a list of exactly which structures were used to generate the rotamer data used here
* Top8000_rotamer_residues.csv , the rotamer assignment of each residue in the dataset

## Top8000_rotamer_central_values
This directory contains, for each of the rotameric canonical amino acids, a table listing rotamer frequency data and the means and standard deviations of each rotamer's bond torsion and bond angle geometries.

## Top8000_rotamer_kinemages
This directory contains kinemage files plotting the rotamer distributions in various chi angle spaces (including both the data points and the contours), for visualization of the distributions.  

## Top8000_rotamer_pct_contour_grids
This directory contains contour/rotamericity grids for sidechain conformation for each of the rotameric canonical amino acids.  Each file's header describes how to interpret it.  Broadly, each file is a list of points that collectively grid out all of chi space (in however many dimensions/chi that sidechain has), plotting rotamericity at each grid point.  Contours drawn through grid points of given values define regions of chi space above a certain rotamericity.  Grid areas with rotamericity below 0.3% (inclusive) represent outlier regions, regions above 2.0% (inclusive) define favored rotamers, and regions in between are defined as allowed.
